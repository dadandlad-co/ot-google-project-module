This Terraform module configures monitoring resources for Google Cloud Platform projects, including alert
policies, notification channels, and dashboards.

## Features

- Creates default and custom alert policies for common metrics
- Configures notification channels for email and Slack
- Sets up uptime checks for HTTP endpoints
- Deploys pre-configured dashboards
- Monitors budget burn rates and quota usage

## Requirements

| Name | Version |
|------|---------|
| terraform | >= 1.9.0 |
| google | >= 6.24.0 |

## Usage

```hcl
module "monitoring" {
  source = "path/to/modules/monitoring"

  project_id         = "my-gcp-project"
  notification_emails = ["alerts@example.com"]

  slack_channels = {
    ops = {
      channel = "#ops-alerts"
      url     = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }
  }

  # Optional: Configure custom thresholds
  cpu_threshold    = 85
  memory_threshold = 90
  alert_duration   = 300
}
```
